## About me

### How it all started...
Most recently, I was previously working in corporate strategy and development, where I supported multi-billion dollar business units and advised C-suite excutives on their short and long-term strategic planning process and operating plans. As well, I've been involved in corporate M&A, where I supported, advised and built business cases and financial analysis on potential acquisiton and partnership opportunities.

In addition to my corporate experience, I have dabbled in business analytics, marketing, and sales and business development.

### Web development? What's next...
A tech enthusiast at heart, I've always been eager to dive into something more entrepreneurial in spirit. In my previous career, I've evaluated various tech platforms and apps and hope to transfer my newly acquired web development skills into building disruptive and innovative ideas.

### What else about me...
Always excited to chat about financial markets and Toronto real estate investment strategies. Oh, and anything automotive related.
